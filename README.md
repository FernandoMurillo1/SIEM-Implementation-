# SIEM Implementation 

## Objective 

The Detection lab project is aimed to establish a controlled enviorment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and event Management (SIEM) systems, generating test telemenrty to mimic real-world scenarious. This hands on experiences was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies. 

### Skills learned 

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical applications.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interperting network logs.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity
- Enhanced knowledge of netowrk protocols and security vulnerabilities

### Tools Used 

- Security Infomration and Event Management (SIEM0 systems for log ingestion and analysis.
- Virtual machine to be able to capture and examine networks and open ports in the VM.
